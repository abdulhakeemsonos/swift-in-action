# Swift code samples for Kotlin in Action, Second Edition [![JetBrains team project](https://jb.gg/badges/team-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub) 

This project contains the code samples from book "[Kotlin in Action, Second Edition](http://kotl.in/in-action)"
by [Sebastian Aigner](https://twitter.com/sebi_io), [Roman Elizarov](https://twitter.com/relizarov), [Svetlana Isakova](https://twitter.com/sveta_isakova),
and [Dmitry Jemerov](https://twitter.com/intelliyole).

To build the project, import it as Swift project in Xcode.

Each of the chapters have a `main` file for running functions prefixed with `run` in 
each file for demonstrating essential concepts in swift.

You can uncomment the methods prefixed with `run` and then build each file in a chapter using the below command:
>`Should show command for building each file in each chapter`


The numbering of the sample files corresponds to the order in which they
appear in the book, but not necessary the specific listing numbers.
